# BlockChain Anomaly Detection
### This project aims at detecting anomalous patterns in Bitcoin transactions using unsupervised machine learning. We experimented with a variety of techniques: Isolation Forest; CBLOF; PCA; K-means clustering; and Autoencoder methods in finding potential fraud in transactions with the Bitcoin network. We implemented these with a dataset that shows information, such as the number of inputs and outputs in transactions, the amount of Bitcoin, and whether the transactions are flagged as suspicious. We implemented advanced fraud detection and made blockchains safe and more dependable. We are going to evaluate the performance of our models based on the measures of precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. That's being said, the experimental results presented within this specific task revealed quite promising, showing that the model devised is pretty effective in anomaly detection. That contribution is valuable not only for ongoing research but also for practical implications in security for the world of cryptocurrencies.
